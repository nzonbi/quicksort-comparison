# quicksort in various languages

## haskell, go, javascript, and experimental deathspeak

A code comparison of the quicksort algorithm
written in haskell, go lang, javascript and deathspeak.
The haskell implementation is a haskell canonical example.

The other versions were implemented aiming for a similar style
to the haskell version, rather than trying to be 
optimal for each language.
